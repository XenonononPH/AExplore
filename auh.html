The story ends with her teardrops of innocence falling into an oasis which brings rise to the majestic pearl towering the village, bringing its residents' goodness once again. The theme is obvious in the parks' architecture with its pearl seen from outside the waterpark. All the characters, shops and restaurants are also based on the story.</div>

                    Built on Saadiyat Island (the island of happiness), a natural 27-km² island a third of the size of Paris, the Cultural District houses a number of renowned cultural establishments: 
                    the Louvre Abu Dhabi, designed by architect Jean Nouvel; the Zayed National Museum by Norman Foster; and the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi by Frank Gehry. 
                    The Cultural District is part of a new urban complex just outside the historic Abu Dhabi city center, with housing for 150,000 residents. </p>
