The engineering features are a major accomplishment for the period of construction. The mosque consists of a prayer hall, decorated with arches and featuring ventilation openings and a mihrab (prayer niche pointing to Mecca). A central pillar divides the internal space into four squares of similar dimensions, covered by domed ceilings.</p>

Considered the oldest fort in the United Arab Emirates, it has served previously as both a defensive building and a home for the ruling family. And for many centuries, it was the only stone building along the Fujairah coast. The fort has three major sections, several halls, one square tower, and two round towers. In recent years, it has been fully restored to its former glory.</p>

The day begins with 20 bulls battling each other, and numbers slowly dwindle as winners move on to the next round.</p>
